        began with a simple mission: to bring the best-in-class furniture to
        your home and office. Back then, furniture shopping felt like a chore -
        impersonal stores with generic options. We envisioned a different
        experience, a place where you could discover unique pieces that
        reflected your style and created inspiring spaces. That's the fire that
        ignited our journey, and it's still what fuels us today.
